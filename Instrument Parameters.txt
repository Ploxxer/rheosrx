Use in conjuction with file_creation_windows_prod.py

Request from ClientConfigurations should return "/Shared/" which would be the first step in the path for egnyte

The request for the specific instrument should return 4 seperate values:

1. LocalDriveLetter
2. WorkstationId
3. AutomatedSubfolderList
4. NetworkFilePath

1. LocalDriveLetter in most cases should be "C:\"
included in the local_path

2. WorkstationId as of now is set as "SapioAutomation"
comes right after the drive letter within local_path

3. AutomatedSubfolderList should be comma seperated, "A,B,C,D"
sets amount of subfolders to be created within ./Raw_data

4. NetworkFilePath as of now is set as "Lab Data/Sapio-Sandbox/{InstrumentName}/{Date(YYYY-MM)}/{ExpName}/Raw_Data"
works as part of the path template for both egnyte and the local machine
values within curly braces are replaced within the code with the proper values
